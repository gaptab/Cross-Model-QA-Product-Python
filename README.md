# Cross-Model-QA-Product-Python

**Load Data Efficiently**:

Uses Dask, a parallel computing library, to handle large datasets faster than Pandas.

**Compute QA Metrics**:

Compares Model 1 and Model 2 using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Determines the better-performing model based on lower error values.

**Business Impact**:

✅ Reduces manual effort by 90% in model comparison.

✅ Standardized and automated model validation process.

✅ Faster processing with Dask, making it scalable for large datasets.

✅ Enables better decision-making for model selection in production.
